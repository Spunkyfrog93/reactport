      <p>
        I graduated with a degree in American Studies with a focus in race and gender 
        from the University of Mary Washington in 2016. I began my career at a sustainability nonprofit called Good360
        as a Nonprofit Development Specialist.
        I am currently an Administrative Assistant with a trade association in Washington D.C. I dream of becoming 
        a website developer, because I love to create.
